## Create an environment using venv

```
cd myproject
```

In your terminal, type:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.

## Activate your environment

```
# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"

## Install Dependencies in your environment

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Run your Streamlit app.

```
streamlit run /src/main.py
```
